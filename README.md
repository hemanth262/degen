# Macbook Subscription

## Overview

The Macbook Subscription Smart Contract is an Ethereum-based smart contract written in Solidity. It allows users to participate in a subscription service by redeeming tokens for different models of Macbooks. The smart contract is an ERC-20 token with additional functionality to handle Macbook redemptions and token transfers.

## Features

1. **Token Minting:** The owner can mint new tokens to a specified address using the `mintTokens` function.

2. **Token Burning:** Users can burn a specific amount of their tokens with the `burn` function, provided they have sufficient funds.

3. **Macbook Redemption:** Users can redeem Macbooks of different models (Air, Pro, M1) by calling the `redeemMacbook` function with the desired model number.

4. **Token Transfer:** Users can transfer their tokens to another address using the `transferMacbookTokens` function.

5. **Ownership:** The smart contract utilizes the Ownable pattern, allowing the contract owner to perform privileged actions.

6. **Events:** The contract emits events (`SubscriptionRedeemed` and `TokensBurned`) to provide transparency and allow easy tracking of key activities.

## Macbook Models and Costs

- **Macbook Air:** 100 tokens
- **Macbook Pro:** 200 tokens
- **Macbook M1:** 500 tokens

## Usage

### Deployment

Deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, specifying the initial token details.

### Interacting with the Contract

- Mint tokens to specific addresses using the `mintTokens` function.
- Burn a specified amount of tokens using the `burn` function.
- Redeem a Macbook by calling the `redeemMacbook` function with the desired model number.
- Transfer tokens to another address using the `transferMacbookTokens` function.
- Check the Macbook model associated with an address using the `getMacbookModel` function.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that the contract owner is a trusted entity, as they have the ability to mint tokens.
- Users should carefully manage their token balance to avoid insufficient funds for redemptions or transfers.
